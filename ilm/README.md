## Infilling by Language Modeling (ILM)
We modify the code from ILM framework [_Enabling language models to fill in the blanks_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05339) (Donahue et al. 2020) by adding support for masking smiles strings.
The codebase that we started from is available at https://github.com/chrisdonahue/ilm/tree/master

We also use the model architecture defined by the nanoGPT repository (https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT) for infilling.
